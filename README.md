# Immersion and theme
From the strat I knew I wanted a level that was different form the lvels I played in Quake. I wanted to do a medieval castle cause I don't see enough of those especially in Quake. I had to look for the right ones but I eventually found textures that resembled an old abandoned castle used by the dark side. Gives into the idea of players being trapped in a free for all.

As you can see wiht the colums and carpet as well as a throne, I made the environment feel like a castle.

# Guidance and Orientation 
Originally I wanted to keep the are as dark as I wanted to give off a horror vibe during the castle, but it was proving too difficult for the players to see, so I tried adding as much lighting as I could but just enough so there would still be dark spaces in certain areas.

As you can see there are still some dark areas added and I added torches to continue the theme of castle. I might go back and decrease the brightness so make it more scary for players.
